# python-web-crawler


A python project to crawl a website and get information.
In this , I wrote a python protgram to get lyrics of billie eilish songs from a website called "metrolyrics.com" into a txt file.
The program asks the song name and outputs a text file wtih that song lyrics in it , if the song is not in the website present it prompts as not found.
